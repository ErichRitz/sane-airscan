# sane-airscan -- Linux support of Apple AirScan (eSCL) compatible document scanners

Currently many new document scanners and MFPs come with Apple AirScan
support, also known as AirPrint scanning or eSCL protocol. And number of
AirScan-compatible devices tends to grow.

Looks that AirScan becomes de-facto standard protocol for document
scanners, connected to the network. This is very convenient for (Apple)
users, because installation of the new scanner becomes trivial task,
everything "just works" without need to worry about device drivers,
network configuration etc.

Unfortunately, Linux doesn't support AirScan, and the goal of this
project is to fix this situation.
