.
.SH "NAME"
\fBsane\-airscan\fR \- SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) scanners and MFP
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBsane\-airscan\fR implements a SANE backend that provides access network scanners and MFP using eSCL protocol, also known as AirScan or AirPrint scan\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
If scanner and computer are connected to the same LAN segment, everything expected to "just work" out of box, without any need of manual configuration\.
.
.P
Unfortunately, automatic configuration doesn\'t work if there is an IP router between computer and scanner\. At this case scanner can be added manually\.
.
.P
The sane\-airscan loads its configuration files from the following places:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

1\. /etc/sane\.d/airscan\.conf
2\. /etc/sane\.d/airscan\.d/*
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The configuration file syntax is very similar to the \.INI file syntax\.
.
.P
To manually configure a device, add the following section to the configuration file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[devices]
"Kyocera MFP Scanner" = http://192\.168\.1\.102:9095/eSCL
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fB[devices]\fR section contains all manually configured devices, one line per device, and each line contains a device name on a left side of equation and device URL on a rights side\.
.
.P
To figure out the device URL, you need to know its components:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http://192\.168\.1\.102:9095/eSCL
       <\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-> <\-\-> <\-\->
             |         |    |
             |         |    `\-\- URL path
             |         `\-\-\-\-\-\-\- IP port
             `\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Device IP address
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The most reliable way to obtain it information, is to execute the following command, using a Linux computer, connected to the same LAN segment as as a scanner:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ avahi\-browse _uscan\._tcp \-r
= wlp2s0 IPv4 Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn
   hostname = [KM7B6A91\.local]
   address = [192\.168\.1\.102]
   port = [9095]
   txt = ["duplex=T" "is=platen,adf" "cs=color,grayscale,binary"
   "UUID=4509a320\-00a0\-008f\-00b6\-002507510eca"
   "pdl=application/pdf,image/jpeg" "note="
   "ty=Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn" "rs=eSCL"
   "representation=https://\.\.\."
   "adminurl=https://\.\.\." "vers=2\.62" "txtvers=1"]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Address and port are on obvious places\. Please notice the "rs=eSCL" record in the txt section \- this is the path component of the URL\.
.
.P
If running avahi\-browse on same LAN segment as a scanner is not possible, you will have to follow a hard way\. Your administrator must know device IP address, consult your device manual for the eSCL port, and the URL path component most likely is the "/eSCL", though on some devices it may differ\.
.
.SH "FILES"
.
.TP
\fB/etc/sane\.d/airscan\.conf\fR, \fB/etc/sane\.d/airscan\.d/*\fR
The backend configuration files
.
.TP
\fB/usr/LIBDIR/sane/libsane\-airscan\.so\fR
The shared library implementing this backend
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
\fBSANE_DEBUG_AIRSCAN\fR
This variable if set to \fBtrue\fR or non\-zero numerical value, enables debug messages, that are printed to stdout
.
.TP
\fBSANE_CONFIG_DIR\fR
This variable alters the search path for configuration files\. This is a colon\-separated list of directories\. These directories are searched for the airscan\.conf configuration file and for the airscan\.d subdirectory, before the standard path (/etc/sane\.d) is searched\.
